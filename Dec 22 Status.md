Summary of Changes Made:

Initial State Issue:

- Original implementation used URL parameters causing chart redraw/flash issues
- Multiple unnecessary files handling state management
- Complex React-based implementation
- Duplicated theme/mode handling across files

Changes Implemented:

1. Architecture Shift

- Moved from URL parameters to API-driven updates
- Simplified to vanilla JavaScript
- Consolidated theme handling
- Removed React dependencies

2. File Structure Cleanup

- Removed 10 unnecessary files
- Kept 7 essential files
- Merged functionality into test-api.html
- Separated color/style definitions

3. API Implementation

- get-chart-values.js handles initial load and updates
- Pusher integration for real-time updates
- Simple POST endpoint structure
- Error handling and validation

4. Core Functionality

- Chart updates without redraw issues
- Theme switching (light/dark)
- Value-based color changes
- Responsive sizing

Current Status:

- Ready for deployment testing
- API endpoint prepared for Glide integration
- Simplified codebase maintained all functionality
- Improved performance with reduced complexity

Next Steps:

1. Deploy and test API endpoint
2. Verify Glide integration
3. Monitor performance
4. Document API usage for team

Update at 7:35PM:

STATUS REPORT: HIGHCHARTS REAL-TIME IMPLEMENTATION (UPDATED)

CURRENT STATE:

- Chart showing "Unable to load chart data. Please refresh the page"
- Initial API call failing due to missing Row ID
- Successful Glide init call with Row ID coming later
- Row ID confirmed in logs: 'v5nw0CyBSzVl5Nt8qLo5'

CRITICAL ISSUES:

1. Row ID not available during initial page load
2. Multiple failed retry attempts (3 failures in logs)
3. Chart error state visible to users

TRIED AND WORKING:

- Pusher integration successful
- Real-time updates functioning
- Dark mode implementation
- Error handling and loading states
- Row ID successfully passed in Glide init call

TRIED BUT NOT WORKING:

- Initial @glideapps/tables library approach (initialization errors)
- Direct data access without Row ID
- JSON column parsing without specific Row ID
- Initial API call with Row ID (timing issue)

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION:

- Using Glide REST API instead of tables library
- Row ID-based queries
- Value storage for repeat visits
- Loading state during data fetch

LATEST LOGS REVEAL:

1. Initial load request at 05:29:37 PM - fails
2. Glide init request at 05:29:40 PM - succeeds with Row ID
3. Values updating correctly after Glide init
4. Multiple retry attempts occurring

NEXT STEPS:

1. Modify initialization to wait for Row ID
2. Consider local storage for Row ID persistence
3. Improve error messaging during load
4. Remove dependency on secondary Glide call
5. Address multiple retry attempts

KEY FILES MODIFIED:

- get-chart-values.js
- package.json (added node-fetch)

OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS:

1. Performance impact of direct Glide API calls
2. Error handling for missing Row IDs
3. Caching strategy for frequent visitors
4. How to get Row ID before initial page load
5. Best approach to handle loading state
