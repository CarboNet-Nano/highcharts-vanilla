Summary of Changes Made:

Initial State Issue:

- Original implementation used URL parameters causing chart redraw/flash issues
- Multiple unnecessary files handling state management
- Complex React-based implementation
- Duplicated theme/mode handling across files

Changes Implemented:

1. Architecture Shift

- Moved from URL parameters to API-driven updates
- Simplified to vanilla JavaScript
- Consolidated theme handling
- Removed React dependencies

2. File Structure Cleanup

- Removed 10 unnecessary files
- Kept 7 essential files
- Merged functionality into test-api.html
- Separated color/style definitions

3. API Implementation

- get-chart-values.js handles initial load and updates
- Pusher integration for real-time updates
- Simple POST endpoint structure
- Error handling and validation

4. Core Functionality

- Chart updates without redraw issues
- Theme switching (light/dark)
- Value-based color changes
- Responsive sizing

Current Status:

- Ready for deployment testing
- API endpoint prepared for Glide integration
- Simplified codebase maintained all functionality
- Improved performance with reduced complexity

Next Steps:

1. Deploy and test API endpoint
2. Verify Glide integration
3. Monitor performance
4. Document API usage for team
