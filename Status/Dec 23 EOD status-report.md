# Highcharts Implementation Status Report - Dec 23, 2024

## Currently Working

- Chart rendering with correct values/styling
- Dark/light mode switching
- Color-coding based on values
- Real-time updates via Pusher
- Error handling/logging
- Chart loading screen
- Smooth transitions between states

## Failed Approaches

- CSS Loading States

  - Used data-state attributes
  - Added loading animations
  - Failed: White flash still visible
  - Why: CSS loads after page render

- Background Color Pre-loading

  - Set initial colors via inline styles
  - Failed: Colors flickered
  - Why: Theme uncertainty before API call

- DOM Manipulation

  - Hide/show content
  - Visibility controls
  - Failed: Caused layout shifts
  - Why: Iframe rendering behavior

- 3D Chart Implementation
  - Added toggle button
  - Modified chart config
  - Failed: Chart disappeared
  - Why: Rendering issues in Glide iframe

## Current Issues

- Chart disappears when 3D option added
- Loss of loading screen state
- Data flows correctly but no visualization
- Blank chart after container resize

## Core Architecture

- Netlify Functions for API endpoints
- Pusher for real-time updates
- Vanilla JavaScript/Highcharts implementation
- No React dependencies

## File Structure

```
├── api/
│   ├── get-chart-values.js
│   ├── update-chart-data.js
│   └── pusher.js
├── test-api.html
└── package.json
```

## Next Steps Priority

1. Restore last stable version
2. Re-approach 3D implementation
   - Minimal changes to core rendering
   - Test in Glide environment first
3. Maintain loading screen
4. Keep current error handling

## Critical Metrics

- Initial render time
- Time to first meaningful paint
- Animation smoothness
- Theme transition timing
